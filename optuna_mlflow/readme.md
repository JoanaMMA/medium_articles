## Data
The dataset is available here in the repo for ease, however, the source is here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease where more information about the variables and data collection can be found.

## Creating the environment
To create the conda environment used for the work in this repo, you can run the `setup.sh` file which will create the environment automatically. Please note I work on a Windows machine. I expect the setup to run on other systems, but this is untested.
